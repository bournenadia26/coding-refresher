This folder contains the files for a semi-working text-based adventure game I created to explore JavaFX
and refresh myself on Java. It relies on a node system to navigate between story 'scenes' at the press of a button.

A little bit of the story was written, but for the most part I spent my time refining battle logic.
The work was split between many classes (Character, Enemy, Battle, etc.) and includes:
- menu and button initialization
- proper menu refreshes
- unique party member AI 
- enemy AI
- functioning spells and back buttons via a node system
- cooldown trackers 
- win/loss mechanics
- healing and damage systems
- buff and ailment systems
- party dialogue reactions
- proper reset upon win/loss
- a working party change menu
& more I've probably implemented but since forgotten about 
(including design/layout features like font, color, button placement, itatlics/bold, etc.)

The character names have been reduced to abbreviations for anonymity's sake.
